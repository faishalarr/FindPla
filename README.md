# plafinder

Hello this is my first project using Flutter,

Because recently i am interested in Gunpla World i would like to make some Mobile Apps that contain Gunpla kits that available around.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
